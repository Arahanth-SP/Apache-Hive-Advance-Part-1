# Hive Join Optimizations

Hive Join Optimizations:
3 important kind of join optimizations:
1.	Map Side Join (is very important)
2.	Bucket Map Join
3.	SMB (Sort Merge Bucket Join)

•	There is no reduce phase. The entire joining activity will happen at the mapper end.

Can we always have a join as map side join?
However if certain criteria matches then we go for mapside join.

We want to join 2 tables
•	Out of 2 tables, one table should be smaller so that it can fit in memory of datanode.

We want to join 3 or more tables
•	All the tables except one are smaller to fit in memory 

Consider we have 2 tables
1.	Orders
2.	Customers
One of them is big table and other is small table
