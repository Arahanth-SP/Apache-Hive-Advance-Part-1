Partitioning works well when we have low cardinality.
That means number of distinct values in the column is low.
Example: state (50)
It’s not good customer_id (1 million customer) cardinality is high i.e. number of distinct values in the column is 1 million.
Customers table:
Select * from customers where customer_id = ?
In such a case you should go for bucketing.
How many partitions gets created? 
It is equal to number of distinct values.
In case of bucketing we have to define a fixed number of buckets during table creation.
In case of states (50):
How many partitions gets created – 50 partitions.
But bucketing is based on modulo function that we have to determine
In HDFS
•	Each partition is a folder
•	Each bucket is a file

Suppose there are 10 product ids
And there are 3 buckets
Product ID = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
Number of buckets = 0,1,2
Bucketing = 1%3 (1 modulo 3)
                      6 % 3 = 0

Product ids
1,
2,
3,
4,
5,
.
.
100000
You are dividing this into 3 buckets
bucket_0 - 3, 6
bucket_1 – 1, 4
bucket_2 – 2, 5
