Partitioning works well when there is low cardinality

That means Number of distinct values in the column is low.
Example: State
Itâ€™s not good customer_id (1 million customer) cardinality is high i.e. number of distinct values in the column is 1 million.
Customers table:
Select * from customers where customer_id = ?
In such a case you should go for bucketing.
How many partitions gets created? 
It is equal to number of distinct values.
In case of bucketing we have define a fixed number of buckets during table creation
