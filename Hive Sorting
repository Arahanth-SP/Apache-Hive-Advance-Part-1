# Order by, sort by, distribute by, cluster by


# Order by

Order by gurantees total ordering
Only 1 Reducer is used

There are some limitations in the "order by" clause.
In strict mode limit clause is compulsory
hive.mapred.mode=strict

order of Null's by default is Null's are shown first when sorting in ascending order

# Create a table by name order

use trendytech;

create table order(order_id string, order_value int)
row format delimited fields terminated by ',';

# Load data into table from text file

load data local inpath '/home/cloudera/Downloads/order.txt'
into table order;

select * from order;

hive> use trendytech;
OK

# Now use order by in you query

select order_value from order order by order_value;

hive> select order_value from order order by order_value;


# Sort By

Sort by can use multiple reducers
Local sorting will happen on each reducer
we cannot guarantee a total ordering
Below 2 properties define how many reducers will be there:

set hive.exec.reducers.bytes.per.reducer
set mapred.reduce.tasks
