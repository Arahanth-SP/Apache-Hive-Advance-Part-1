3 Categories of Optimizations

1. Table structure level optimization: Partitioning and Bucketing
2. query level optimization : Join optimizations
3. simplifying the query expressions : Windowing functions

1.	Try to minimize the number of JOIN columns if possible 
Because if we minimize the join columns then there will be less mapreduce jobs.

•	Internally even a join is executed as a map reduce job.
•	mapper will give the join column as the key and mapper gives all the other columns as the value.
•	Key – The join column
•	Value-  all the remaining columns

table1 (product_id, all the other columns)
table1 (key, values)
table2 (id, all the other columns list2 5)
table2(key, values)
The Join column is the key 
The remaining columns are the values
