3 Categories of Optimizations

1. Table structure level optimization: Partitioning and Bucketing
2. query level optimization : Join optimizations
3. simplifying the query expressions : Windowing functions

1.	Try to minimize the number of JOIN columns if possible 
Because if we minimize the join columns then there will be less mapreduce jobs.

•	Internally even a join is executed as a map reduce job.
•	mapper will give the join column as the key and mapper gives all the other columns as the value.
•	Key – The join column
•	Value-  all the remaining columns

table1 (product_id, all the other columns)
table1 (key, values)
table2 (id, all the other columns list2 5)
table2(key, values)
The Join column is the key 
The remaining columns are the values

We have 2 stages for this mapreduce job
•	Map
•	Reduce

Whenever we can write the join in a way that reducer does not have to do anything then we say such join as map side join.
Whenever feasible then we should try to write the join in a way that it is a map side join only.
First condition for map side join is:
•	All tables except one should be small enough to fit in memory.
One table is small and other is big
•	Two tables should be small and one should be big.
•	Except one table all the other tables should be small.

N1 – Block1 of BIG TABLE with 25000 Rows – ALL 100 ROWS OF SMALL TABLE
N2 – Block2 of BIG TABLE with 25000 Rows – ALL 100 ROWS OF SMALL TABLE
N3 – Block3 of BIG TABLE with 25000 Rows – ALL 100 ROWS OF SMALL TABLE
N4 – Block4 of BIG TABLE with 25000 Rows – ALL 100 ROWS OF SMALL TABLE
