# Advance Hive

# Optimizing Queries on Big Data
# So the optimization in hive are of 3 kinds mainly

1. Table structure level optimization

We have two choices 
Partitioning
Bucketing

Both work on same process: divide the data into smaller parts

Example: If you have 40000 rows of data can you divide this data into  - scan all 40000 records
10000 rows - scanned
10000 rows 
10000 rows 
10000 rows

Is there a way we can scan only portion of records i.e instead of scanning 40000 records we can scan portion of it 10000 rows


Queries on Big Data

Hive tries to simplify query writing and improve query performance in many ways.

1. Design Tables to optimize queries : Partitioning and Bucketing
2. Structure queries so they run faster: Join optimizations
3. Simplify query expressions so they are easy to maintain: Window Functions


 Design Tables: When we talk about table design to optimize queries

1. Partitioning and 
2. Bucketing of Tables


1. Design Tables to optimize queries
2. Structure queries so they run faster
3. Simplify query expressions so they are easy to maintain



2. Optimizing the query that we are writing

Join takes lot of time
When we talk about query level optimization we mostly talk about join optimization

3. Simplify Query Expressions: 

Windowing functions
