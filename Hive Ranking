Note: we will be considering rank_dataset.csv as our dataset for practicals

# Ranking based on scores

select name, score, rank() over(order by score desc) as ranking
from rank_test;

hive> select name, score, rank() over(order by score desc) as ranking
    > from rank_test;

# Dense_Ranking based on scores

select name, score, dense_rank() over(order by score desc) as ranking
from rank_test;

hive> select name, score, dense_rank() over(order by score desc) as ranking
    > from rank_test;

# Row Number: Row Number assigns unique numbers to each row given the order by clause

select name, score, row_number() over(order by score desc) as ranking
from rank_test;

# Row Number with partition by clause

select name, score, row_number() over(partition by name order by score desc) as ranking from rank_test;

The above query first groups based on names and then do the ranking for each group.

hive> select name, score, row_number() over(partition by name order by score desc) as ranking from rank_test;
