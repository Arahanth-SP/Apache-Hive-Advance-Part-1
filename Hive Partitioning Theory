Partitioning Tables in Hive

Split data into smaller subsets
Separate records into manageable parts based on column value

Example: Consider an e-commerce site with order data from across the United States

You have 500 MB data of 4 node cluster: 500 MB divided into 4 parts based on default block size of 128 MB
Records will be split across 4 machines in the cluster

Example Query: select * from Orders where state ="WA"

So Query will run on all 4 machines in parallel: All records on each machine need to be scanned to retrieve results

What if the dataset is huge (not 500MB instead goes in Tera bytes) on each node?
What if this is the most common query run?

Partitioning: Customers in the US; Data may be naturally split into
